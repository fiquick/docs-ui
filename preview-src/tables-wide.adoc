[options="header",cols="<5m,<8,2"]
|===
|Name |Description|Notes

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.connections_opened
|The total number of Bolt connections opened since startup. This includes both succeeded and failed connections. Useful for monitoring load via the Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|+++<div class="box">
  <span class="label label--deprecated">Deprecated in 5.15</span>
</div>+++

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.connections_closed|The total number of Bolt connections closed since startup. This includes both properly and abnormally ended connections. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.connections_running|The total number of Bolt connections that are currently executing Cypher and returning results. Useful to track the overall load on Bolt connections. This is limited to the number of Bolt worker threads that have been configured via `dbms.connector.bolt.thread_pool_max_size`. Reaching this maximum indicated the server is running at capacity. (gauge)
|+++<div class="box">
  <span class="label label--deprecated">Deprecated in 5.15</span>
</div>+++

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.connections_idle
|The total number of Bolt connections that are not currently executing Cypher or returning results. (gauge)
|+++<div class="box">
  <span class="label label--new">Added in 5.15</span>
</div>+++

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.messages_received
|The total number of messages received via Bolt since startup. Useful to track general message activity in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|+++<div class="box">
  <span class="label label--deprecated">Deprecated in 5.15</span>
</div>+++

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.messages_started
|The total number of messages that have started processing since being received. A received message may have begun processing until a Bolt worker thread becomes available. A large gap observed between `bolt.messages_received` and `bolt.messages_started` could indicate the server is running at capacity. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.messages_done
|The total number of Bolt messages that have completed processing whether successfully or unsuccessfully. Useful for tracking overall load. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.messages_failed
|The total number of messages that have failed while processing. A high number of failures may indicate an issue with the server and further investigation of the logs is recommended. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.accumulated_queue_time
|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is enabled,  the total time in milliseconds that a Bolt message waits in the processing queue before a Bolt worker thread becomes available to process it. Sharp increases in this value indicate that the server is running at capacity. If `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is disabled, the value should be `0`, meaning that messages are directly handed off to worker 
threads. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.accumulated_processing_time
|The total amount of time in milliseconds that worker threads have been processing messages. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.response_success
|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.response_metrics` is enabled, number of `encounteredsuccess` responses. (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.response_ignored
|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.response_metrics` is enabled, number of `encounteredignored` responses (counter)
|

|<prefix>.dbms.bolt.response_failed
|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.response_metrics` is enabled, number of `encounteredinstances` of a given error code. (counter)
|
