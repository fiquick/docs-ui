= Developer page example
:page-theme: developer

Example blocks should have a background colour in the docs theme

== No TOC

Developer pages should not have a table of contents.

Most developer pages have been redirected to docs pages.

Other developer pages contain useful information, but we don't want to confuse users by having a TOC that would almost always take them away from developer pages.
