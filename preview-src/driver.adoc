Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.


[.disconnected]
== Installing the Driver

The latest version of the Neo4j Python Driver can be installed using  the `pip` command.

* link:#[View Package on Pypi]
* link:#[View Code]

.Installing Dependencies
[source,bash]
----
pip install neo4j
----


[.first]
== Creating the Driver

.Using the Neo4j Python Driver
[source,python]
----
# Import the neo4j dependency
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Create a new Driver instance
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", # <1>
    auth=("neo4j", "neo")) # <2>

# <3> Verify connection details
driver.verify_connectivity()
----
// [source,python]
// ----
// include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python/main/example/index.py[tag=import]
// include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python/main/example/index.py[tag=driver]
// ----

You should create one <<Driver>> object per Neo4j instance.
The driver accepts two arguments, *(1)* a connection string and *(2)* an authentication token.

Once you have created a Driver instance, you can call the *(3)* link:#[`verify_connectivity()`] method to verify that your credentials are correct.

== Open a Session

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python/main/example/index.py[tag=import]
// ----

.Opening a Session
[source,python]
----
with driver.session() as session:
    # Run a Cypher Statement within a transaction
----

When you want to query Neo4j, you will first open a <<Session>>.

Sessions manage connections between the Driver and the Neo4j instance or cluster.
These are lightweight objects that can be opened and closed with no overhead.

== Reading From Neo4j

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python/main/example/index.py[tag=session.readTransaction]
// ----

.Reading from Neo4j
[source,python]
----
    # Define a Unit of work to run within a Transaction (`tx`)
    def get_movies(tx, title):
        return tx.run("""
            MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
            WHERE m.title = $title // <1>
            RETURN p.name AS name
            LIMIT 10
        """, title=title)

    # Execute get_movies within a Read Transaction
    session.read_transaction(get_movies,
        title="Arthur" # <2>
    )
----

To read from a Neo4j Instance you should use the session to create a read transaction.
The session provides a  `read_transaction()` method, which should be called with a function represent the <1> unit of work.

The unit of work has one positional argument, representing the transaction and can accept one or more optional arguments.

== Write to Neo4j

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python/main/example/index.py[tag=session.writeTransaction]
// ----

.Writing to Neo4j
[source,python]
----
    # Call tx.run() to execute the query to create a Person node
    def create_person(tx, name):
        return tx.run(
            "CREATE (p:Person {name: $name})",
            name=name
        )
----

Neo4j supports <<ACID>> to ensure that data is data is safely and consistently stored.
A transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

The `write_transaction()` method provides the user with the ability to execute a unit of work.

In a <<Cluster>>, your queries will always be routed to the leader of the cluster.

[.last]
== Close Connections

Once you have finished with your Driver instance, you can call the `.close()` method release any resources still held by the instance.

.Close the Connection
[source,python]
driver.close()
